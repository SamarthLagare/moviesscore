## 🔑 API Key

This project uses a public developer-level API key for TMDB, which is sufficient for personal use.  
If you plan to deploy this for a wider audience, it is **strongly recommended** that you:

1. Register for your own free API key on the [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
2. Replace the existing `API_KEY` variable in the JavaScript portion of the file.
